# APIs Explained: The Restaurant Analogy

You'll hear developers say "just call the API" like it's obvious. It's not. But after this guide, it will be. An <Term id="api">API</Term> is one of those concepts that sounds complicated but is shockingly simple once you get the right analogy.

## Why APIs Are a Superpower

APIs are how you go from "I built a cute to-do app" to "I built an app that does real things." They connect your code to the entire internet:

- **Weather apps**: Your phone's weather app doesn't have meteorologists inside it. It calls a weather API to get the forecast and displays it prettily. That's it.
- **Login with Google/Apple**: When an app lets you "Sign in with Google," it's using Google's API to verify who you are without handling your password.
- **Payment processing**: When you buy something on Shopify or Etsy, the site calls Stripe's API to charge your card. The shop owner never touches your credit card number.
- **Social media dashboards**: Tools like Buffer or Later use Instagram's and Twitter's APIs to schedule and post content on your behalf.
- **AI features**: Want to add ChatGPT-style responses to your app? Call OpenAI's API. Want to generate images? Call DALL-E's API. The AI lives on their servers — you just send requests and get results.
- **Maps and location**: Google Maps API lets any app embed maps, get directions, or find nearby places. Uber, DoorDash, and Airbnb all use it.

Once you learn to use APIs, you can pull data from anywhere, connect to any service, and build apps that feel massive — even if you're one person working on a laptop.

## The Restaurant

You're at a restaurant. You want food. But you can't just walk into the kitchen and start cooking. Instead:

1. You look at the **menu** (the API documentation)
2. You tell the **waiter** your order (make an API request)
3. The waiter goes to the **kitchen** (the server)
4. The kitchen makes your food (processes the request)
5. The waiter brings it back to you (the API response)

The API is the waiter. It's the middleman between you (the app) and the kitchen (the server/database). You never interact with the kitchen directly.

<Callout variant="denise-says">
APIs clicked for me when I realized they're just a way for two programs to talk to each other. Your weather app doesn't have weather scientists inside it — it asks a weather API "what's the forecast?" and gets data back. That's it. Two programs, passing notes.
</Callout>

## What Does an API Request Look Like?

When you "call" an API, you're basically sending a structured message:

<CodeBlock
  code="// Asking a weather API for the forecast
// This is a real API call using fetch():

const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.weather.com/forecast?city=Los+Angeles'
);

const data = await response.json();

console.log(data);
// {
//   city: 'Los Angeles',
//   temperature: 72,
//   condition: 'Sunny',
//   humidity: 45
// }"
  language="javascript"
  explanation="fetch() is how JavaScript makes API requests. You give it a URL (the API's address), and it sends a request and waits for a response. The response comes back as JSON — which is basically a JavaScript object with curly braces and key-value pairs. That's your data! Now you can show the temperature on your app."
/>

## The Four Types of Requests

APIs have four main operations, and they map to real-world actions:

<CodeBlock
  code="GET    → Read data    → 'Show me the menu'
POST   → Create data   → 'I would like to order the pasta'
PUT    → Update data   → 'Actually, make that with extra cheese'
DELETE → Remove data   → 'Cancel my order'

// In code:
// GET: fetch a list of users
fetch('/api/users');

// POST: create a new user
fetch('/api/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Denise', email: 'hi@denise.com' })
});

// DELETE: remove a user
fetch('/api/users/123', {
  method: 'DELETE'
});"
  language="javascript"
  explanation="GET is the most common — it just fetches data. POST creates something new (like signing up for an account). PUT updates existing data (like editing your profile). DELETE removes something. These are called HTTP methods, and every API uses them. When you load a website, your browser is doing a GET request behind the scenes."
/>

<Callout variant="tip">
GET requests don't need a body (you're just asking for data). POST and PUT usually need a body (the data you're sending). Think of it like: GET is a question, POST is filling out a form.
</Callout>

## Status Codes: The API's Mood

When the API responds, it includes a status code that tells you how things went:

| Code | Meaning | Restaurant version |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **200** | OK, here's your data | "Here's your food!" |
| **201** | Created successfully | "Your order has been placed!" |
| **400** | Bad request | "I don't understand your order" |
| **401** | Unauthorized | "Do you have a reservation?" |
| **403** | Forbidden | "That table is for VIPs only" |
| **404** | Not found | "We don't serve that here" |
| **500** | Server error | "The kitchen is on fire" |

<CodeBlock
  code="const response = await fetch('/api/users/123');

if (response.ok) {
  // Status 200-299: Everything worked!
  const user = await response.json();
  console.log('Got the user:', user);
} else if (response.status === 404) {
  console.log('User not found!');
} else {
  console.log('Something went wrong:', response.status);
}"
  language="javascript"
  explanation="response.ok is true if the status code is in the 200 range (success). You should always check this before trying to use the data, because if the API returned an error, there won't be useful data in the response. The status code tells you exactly what went wrong so you can handle it gracefully."
/>

## JSON: The Language APIs Speak

APIs send and receive data as **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation). It looks like this:

<CodeBlock
  code="// JSON is basically a JavaScript object:
{
  'user': {
    'name': 'Denise',
    'email': 'hi@denise.com',
    'followers': 1500,
    'topics': ['React', 'Python', 'AI'],
    'isPro': true
  }
}

// Strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, nested objects
// That's all JSON is. No functions, no fancy stuff."
  language="json"
  explanation="JSON is the universal language of APIs. Whether the API is built in Python, Java, Go, or whatever — the data it sends back is almost always JSON. And since JSON looks exactly like JavaScript objects, it's super easy to work with in JS. You'll see this format everywhere."
/>

## A Real Example: Fetching Pokemon Data

Let's use a real, free API to fetch Pokemon data:

<CodeBlock
  code="// Fetch data about Pikachu from the Pokemon API
async function getPokemon(name) {
  const response = await fetch(
    'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/' + name
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    console.log('Pokemon not found!');
    return;
  }

  const pokemon = await response.json();

  console.log('Name:', pokemon.name);
  console.log('Height:', pokemon.height);
  console.log('Types:', pokemon.types.map(t => t.type.name));
}

getPokemon('pikachu');
// Name: pikachu
// Height: 4
// Types: ['electric']"
  language="javascript"
  explanation="This calls a real, free API (the Pokemon API). We send a GET request with the Pokemon's name in the URL. The API sends back a JSON object with all the Pokemon's data. We pull out the name, height, and types. You could build a whole Pokedex app with this! The async/await keywords tell JavaScript to wait for the API to respond before continuing."
/>

<Callout variant="warning">
APIs can be slow (they're going across the internet, after all). Always use `async/await` or `.then()` to handle the wait time. If you forget, your code will try to use the data before it arrives, and you'll get `undefined` everywhere.
</Callout>

## API Keys: Your VIP Pass

Many APIs require an API key — a unique code that identifies you:

<CodeBlock
  code="// Without an API key (free, public APIs):
fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu');

// With an API key (most real APIs):
fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key-here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }]
  })
});"
  language="javascript"
  explanation="An API key is like a membership card. It tells the API who you are, tracks your usage, and lets them control access. You usually get one by signing up on the API provider's website. NEVER put API keys in your frontend code where users can see them — always keep them on your server or in environment variables."
/>

## Quick Recap

- An **API** is a waiter between your app and a server
- **GET** reads, **POST** creates, **PUT** updates, **DELETE** removes
- **Status codes** tell you if it worked (200 = good, 404 = not found, 500 = server broke)
- **JSON** is the language APIs speak (looks like JavaScript objects)
- Use **fetch()** in JavaScript to make API requests
- Always use **async/await** because APIs take time to respond
- Keep **API keys** secret (never in frontend code)

<Callout variant="denise-says">
APIs are literally how the internet works. Every time you check the weather, scroll Instagram, or pay for something online, APIs are doing the work behind the scenes. And now you know how to use them. You just unlocked the ability to pull data from anywhere and build apps that connect to real services. That's a superpower.
