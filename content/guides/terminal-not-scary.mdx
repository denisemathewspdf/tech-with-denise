# The Terminal Is Not Scary

I know, I know. You opened it once, saw a blinking cursor on a black screen, and immediately closed it. Same. But here's the thing — the <Term id="terminal">terminal</Term> is honestly just texting your computer instead of clicking around. And once you learn a few commands, you'll feel like a hacker (in the cool way).

## What Even Is the Terminal?

It's an app on your computer where you type commands instead of clicking buttons. That's it. Instead of opening Finder and clicking through folders, you just... type where you want to go.

<CodeBlock
  code="# See what folder you're in right now:
pwd

# See what's in this folder:
ls

# Go into a folder called 'projects':
cd projects

# Go back up one folder:
cd .."
  language="bash"
  explanation="These are like the basic vocabulary words. 'pwd' means 'print working directory' — it tells you where you are. 'ls' means 'list' — it shows you what's in the current folder. 'cd' means 'change directory' — it's how you move around. And 'cd ..' takes you back up one level. That's honestly 80% of what you need to get started."

<Callout variant="denise-says">
I used to think the terminal was only for "real developers." Turns out it's for anyone who's tired of clicking through 47 folders to find one file. Once I learned 'cd' and 'ls,' I never looked back.
</Callout>

## Making Things

You can create files and folders right from the terminal:

<CodeBlock
  code="# Create a new folder:
mkdir my-cool-project

# Create a new file:
touch index.html

# Create a folder AND go into it:
mkdir my-cool-project && cd my-cool-project"
  language="bash"
  explanation="'mkdir' means 'make directory' (directory is just a fancy word for folder). 'touch' creates a new empty file. And that '&&' thing just means 'do this AND THEN do that.' So you can create a folder and jump into it in one line. Efficient queen."
/>

## The Commands You'll Actually Use

Here's your starter pack — the commands that cover like 90% of everyday terminal use:

| Command | What it does | Think of it as... |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `pwd` | Shows where you are | "Where am I?" |
| `ls` | Lists files in current folder | "What's in here?" |
| `cd` | Move to a different folder | "Take me to..." |
| `mkdir` | Create a new folder | "Make me a new room" |
| `touch` | Create a new file | "Make me a new document" |
| `rm` | Delete a file | "Throw this away" |
| `cp` | Copy a file | "Duplicate this" |
| `mv` | Move or rename a file | "Put this over there" |
| `clear` | Clear the screen | "Clean up this mess" |

<Callout variant="warning">
Be careful with `rm` — deleting from the terminal doesn't go to the trash. It's gone gone. Like, permanently. Always double-check what you're deleting. When in doubt, use `ls` first to make sure you're looking at the right files.
</Callout>

## Installing Things with <Term id="npm">npm</Term>

If you're getting into web development, you'll use the terminal to install packages:

<CodeBlock
  code="# Install a package (like downloading an app for your code):
npm install confetti-js

# Run a project:
npm run dev

# See what packages you have:
npm list"
  language="bash"
  explanation="npm is like an app store for code. 'npm install' downloads someone else's code so you can use it in your project. 'npm run dev' starts your project in development mode so you can see it in your browser. You'll use these ALL the time."
/>

## Make It Pretty

Your terminal doesn't have to look boring! You can customize it with themes and colors. Here's what I recommend for beginners:

1. **On Mac**: Use the built-in Terminal app, or download iTerm2 for more customization
2. **On Windows**: Use Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store
3. **Everywhere**: VS Code has a built-in terminal (press Ctrl + backtick to open it)

<Callout variant="tip">
If you use VS Code, the built-in terminal is right there at the bottom of your screen. Press Ctrl + backtick (the key above Tab) to open it. No need to switch between apps!

## Quick Recap

- The terminal is just texting your computer instead of clicking
- Learn `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `touch` — that's your starter pack
- Be careful with `rm` (permanent delete!)
- You'll use `npm install` and `npm run dev` constantly in web dev
- You can make your terminal look cute — it doesn't have to be boring

<Callout variant="denise-says">
You opened the terminal. You typed a command. It did the thing. That's literally how every developer started. You're not behind — you're right on time. Now go practice 'ls' and 'cd' for 5 minutes and watch how fast it clicks.
