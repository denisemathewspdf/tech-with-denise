So I did something a little wild last weekend.

I built **five fully functional web apps** in 48 hours. A talent portal. An onboarding system. An intel dashboard. A client portal. A team hub.

All for a demo. All from scratch. All by myself.

And honestly? It was one of the most clarifying experiences of my career.

## Why I Even Attempted This

Here's the context: I was preparing demos for a potential project in Denver, and I needed to show what modern operations systems could look like. Not wireframes. Not slides. *Real, working applications.*

Most people would hire a dev team or use no-code tools. But **Denise Mathews**, your favorite ops-turned-builder, decided to just... build them myself.

Why? Because I wanted to prove something: **operations people who can code have an unfair advantage.**

## The 5 Apps I Built

Each app solved a real ops problem:

**1. Talent Portal** — Candidate pipeline management with AI resume screening  
**2. Onboarding System** — Automated new hire workflows with document signing  
**3. Intel Dashboard** — Real-time market intelligence with automated research feeds  
**4. Client Portal** — Self-service hub for client documents and communication  
**5. Team Hub** — Internal operations dashboard with task management

Every single one was functional. You could click buttons, submit forms, see data update in real-time. They weren't *pretty* (design is not my superpower 😅), but they *worked*.

## How I Actually Did It

Let's be real: I didn't write everything from scratch. That would be insane.

I used:
- **Next.js** for the framework (fast, modern, great docs)
- **Supabase** for databases (because setting up servers is not a weekend activity)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (pre-made components = lifesaver)
- **Claude & ChatGPT** for coding help (honestly did like 40% of the work)

The secret? I've been building small things for months. This wasn't beginner Denise attempting the impossible — this was practicing-for-months Denise finally going all-in.

## What I Learned

**1. You don't need to know everything.**  
I Googled *constantly*. "How to connect Supabase to Next.js." "Best way to handle file uploads." "Why is this button not working." That's not cheating — that's how real developers work.

**2. AI coding assistants are genuinely game-changing.**  
Claude would write entire components for me. ChatGPT debugged errors in seconds. I focused on *what* I wanted to build; AI handled a lot of the *how*.

**3. Ops people make great builders.**  
You know why? Because we understand the actual workflows. We know what users need because *we are the users*. That domain knowledge is gold.

**4. Building gives you confidence nothing else can.**  
There's something about typing `npm run dev`, seeing your app come to life, and thinking "holy shit, **I made this**" that changes you. It makes you feel capable in a way reading articles never will.

## Why This Matters for Ops People

Here's my hot take: **every operations person should learn to build.**

Not because you'll become a full-time developer (unless you want to). But because:
- You'll stop waiting on engineering for simple tools
- You'll understand what's actually possible (and what's hard)
- You'll communicate better with technical teams
- You'll be able to prototype solutions instead of just describing them

In early-stage startups especially, an ops person who can ship code is worth their weight in gold.

## You Can Do This Too

**Denise Mathews** six months ago couldn't have done this. But I started small. A simple script. Then a basic webpage. Then a form that saved to a database. Then... five apps in one weekend.

If you're in operations and you've ever thought "I wish I could just build this myself" — you can. It'll take time. You'll get frustrated. Your code will be messy at first.

But one day you'll build something real, something useful, something *yours*.

And that feeling? Absolutely worth it.
