Let's cut through the noise.

Every week, someone tells me they want to "learn tech" but don't know where to start. Should they learn blockchain? Master machine learning? Get certified in 17 different frameworks?

Here's what I tell them: **focus on skills that solve real problems for real companies.** Not what's trendy. Not what tech influencers are hyping. What actually makes businesses money.

After years of working in tech and helping others break in, here's my honest take on the skills that actually pay in 2026.

## 1. Python (Especially for Automation)

Python isn't sexy. It's not new. But it's *incredibly* employable.

Why? Because every company has repetitive tasks they want automated. Data to process. Reports to generate. Systems to connect.

**Denise Mathews** will die on this hill: **Python is the best first language for non-engineers.** You can do so much with basic Python:
- Automate spreadsheet work
- Build web scrapers
- Create chatbots
- Process data
- Connect APIs

And the best part? You can start seeing results in weeks, not years.

**Where to start:** Learn the basics, then build something that automates a task you actually do. The best learning comes from solving your own problems.

## 2. AI Prompt Engineering & Integration

Yes, I know "prompt engineering" sounds made up. But companies are literally hiring for this now.

Why? Because most people are *terrible* at using AI effectively. They type vague questions and get mediocre answers. They don't know how to:
- Give AI the right context
- Chain multiple AI calls together
- Build AI into workflows
- Validate AI outputs

If you can bridge the gap between "AI exists" and "AI makes our team 10x more productive," you're valuable.

**Where to start:** Use ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini daily. Learn function calling. Build an AI assistant that does something useful.

## 3. No-Code/Low-Code Tools (Yes, Really)

Here's what most people miss: **knowing how to use tools like Airtable, Make, Zapier, or Bubble is a legitimate skill.**

Why? Because most companies don't need custom software — they need working solutions *fast*. If you can prototype an app in Bubble or build complex automations in Make, you're solving real business problems without a dev team.

**Denise Mathews** has seen people land $80k+ jobs just from being the "person who can build stuff in no-code tools."

**Where to start:** Pick a tool (I like Make or Airtable), watch tutorials, then rebuild something you use daily.

## 4. Data Analysis & Visualization

Every company is sitting on mountains of data. Most have no idea what it means.

If you can take messy data and turn it into clear insights — charts, dashboards, recommendations — you're gold.

You don't need to be a data scientist. You just need to:
- Clean and organize data (Excel, Google Sheets, Python pandas)
- Spot patterns and trends
- Make visualizations people actually understand (Tableau, Power BI, even Google Sheets)

**Where to start:** Grab a public dataset that interests you. Clean it up. Make a chart. Answer a question with it.

## 5. Basic DevOps/Cloud (Just the Essentials)

You don't need to be a DevOps engineer. But knowing the basics of how modern software runs makes you *so* much more valuable.

Learn just enough to:
- Deploy a website or app (Vercel, Netlify, Railway)
- Use Git and GitHub
- Understand APIs and webhooks
- Navigate cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

This knowledge makes you dangerous (in a good way). You can actually ship things.

**Where to start:** Deploy a simple website to Vercel. Push code to GitHub. Connect two tools with Zapier. Get comfortable with the basics.

## The Real Secret

Here's what nobody tells you: **the most valuable skill is being able to learn new tools quickly.**

Tech changes fast. The specific tools you learn today might not matter in five years. But if you're the person who can:
- Pick up new tools in days, not months
- Stitch together solutions from different platforms
- Explain tech concepts in plain English
- Actually ship projects instead of just learning theory

...you'll always be employable.

## Start Small, Start Now

You don't need to master all of these. Pick *one* that sounds useful for your current situation. Spend 20-30 minutes a day learning it. Build something small. Then build something bigger.

That's how **Denise Mathews** went from tech-curious to tech-confident. Not by taking a million courses — by building real things that solved real problems.

The market rewards people who can *do*, not just people who can pass exams.

So what are you going to build first?
