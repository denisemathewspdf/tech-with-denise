Let me guess: you're the operations person at an early-stage startup.

Which means you're also:
- HR (recruiting, onboarding, managing people stuff)
- Finance (invoices, budgets, expense reports)
- IT (buying laptops, managing software, "the Zoom isn't working")
- Office manager (if there's an office)
- Executive assistant (calendars, travel, everyone's miscellaneous requests)
- Project manager (keeping all the trains running)

All at once. With zero budget for help.

Sound familiar? Yeah. Welcome to startup ops. **Denise Mathews** here to tell you: it's exhausting, but it's also completely doable if you're strategic about it.

Here's how.

## The Brutal Reality

Early-stage startups can't afford dedicated people for every function. So operations becomes this weird catch-all role where you're expected to just... figure it out.

The traditional advice is "hire help" or "delegate." Great. To who? With what budget?

The real answer? **You become a one-person operations machine by leveraging AI, automation, and ruthless prioritization.**

## The Ops-of-One Playbook

Here's what actually works when you're flying solo:

### 1. Automate Ruthlessly

If you're doing the same task more than twice a week, automate it. Seriously.

Things I've automated:
- **Onboarding:** New hire gets a Slack message, email with links, calendar invites — all triggered automatically
- **Expense tracking:** Receipts forwarded to an email → automatically logged to spreadsheet
- **Meeting notes:** AI joins calls, transcribes, summarizes, posts to Slack
- **Vendor management:** Contract renewals tracked in Notion with automatic reminders
- **Status updates:** Weekly team updates pulled from project management tools automatically

Tools I use: Zapier, Make, n8n, AI agents (see my [AI tools post](/blog/ai-tools-i-use-every-day) for details).

**Time saved:** Easily 15-20 hours per week. That's half a workweek.

### 2. Make AI Your Co-Pilot

AI isn't just for coding. It's for *everything ops does.*

Ways **Denise Mathews** uses AI daily:
- **Drafting communications** (emails, Slack messages, policy docs)
- **Research** (vendor comparisons, market intel, competitive analysis)
- **Spreadsheet work** (formulas, data cleanup, analysis)
- **Documentation** (SOPs, handbooks, process guides)
- **Decision support** ("here's the situation, what are my options?")

The secret? You're not replacing judgment — you're *scaling* it. AI does the first draft, research, or analysis. You review and finalize. Way faster than doing it all yourself.

### 3. Build Simple Tools (Yes, You)

You don't need to hire a dev team. You can build basic internal tools yourself.

Examples I've built:
- PTO tracker (simple form → Airtable → auto-updates calendar)
- Vendor database (who we use, what we pay, when contracts renew)
- Onboarding checklist (automated tasks for new hires)
- Team directory (searchable, auto-updates from HR system)

With no-code tools (Airtable, Notion, Retool) or basic coding (you can learn this!), you can ship useful tools in a weekend.

**The benefit?** They're exactly what you need. No bloated enterprise software. No waiting on engineering.

### 4. Strategic Laziness™

This is the mindset shift: **being lazy is a skill.**

Ask yourself constantly:
- *Do we actually need to do this?*
- *Can this be simpler?*
- *What's the 80/20 version?*

Examples:
- **Fancy onboarding portal?** Nah. Google Doc with links works fine.
- **Custom expense software?** Nope. Shared spreadsheet + monthly review.
- **Formal performance reviews?** Not yet. Quarterly 1-on-1s + written feedback.

Early-stage startups don't need perfection. They need **good enough, done fast.**

Your job is to keep things from breaking, not to build enterprise infrastructure for a company that doesn't exist yet.

### 5. Use Async Everything

Real-time meetings are expensive. Your time is finite.

Async alternatives:
- Slack instead of meetings (when possible)
- Loom videos instead of walkthroughs
- Written updates instead of status calls
- Shared docs instead of brainstorm sessions

**Rule:** If it can be a message, make it a message. Save meetings for actual decisions or complex discussions.

## What to Actually Focus On

When you're drowning in requests, prioritize:

**Tier 1 (Drop everything):**
- Blocking someone from doing their job
- Legal/compliance emergencies
- Something that loses/makes the company money

**Tier 2 (Today/this week):**
- Hiring pipeline (recruiting is always urgent)
- Leadership requests (they're steering the ship)
- System/process breaks

**Tier 3 (When you have time):**
- Optimizations
- Nice-to-haves
- "Wouldn't it be cool if..."

Everything else? Backlog it. You're not ignoring it — you're triaging.

## The Skills That Matter Most

To do ops-of-one well, **Denise Mathews** thinks you need:

1. **Tech fluency** — comfort with tools, willingness to Google
2. **AI literacy** — knowing how to work with AI effectively  
3. **Automation thinking** — seeing patterns, building systems
4. **Extreme prioritization** — saying no to 80% of requests
5. **Calm under chaos** — everything is always on fire; that's normal

You don't need to be an expert at everything. You need to be good enough at finding solutions fast.

## The Honest Truth

Running ops solo is *hard*. There will be weeks you work 60 hours. Things will fall through the cracks. You'll feel like you're failing.

You're not. You're doing the work of 3 people. Cut yourself some slack.

But here's the upside: you're learning an insane amount. Building resilience. Becoming someone who can solve basically any operational problem.

That skill set? Incredibly valuable. And increasingly rare.

## You've Got This

If you're the solo ops person wondering how to keep all the plates spinning, remember:
- **Automate everything you can**
- **Use AI as your co-pilot**
- **Build simple tools yourself**
- **Be strategically lazy**
- **Prioritize ruthlessly**

You don't need a team. You need systems.

And you can build those.
